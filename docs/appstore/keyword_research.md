## Naming Patterns Observed

### Successful Patterns

1. **Brand + Function** — "ChargePoint Find EV Charging" (clear, keyword-rich)
2. **Brand + Descriptor** — "PlugShare: Charging Stations" (uses colon separator)
3. **Descriptive Brand** — "NearCharge: EV Charger Finder" (self-explanatory)

### Patterns to Avoid

- **Brand only** — Only works for established brands (Electrify America)
- **Generic terms** — "EVCharger" alone is too generic, low differentiation

## Our Differentiators for ASO

| Differentiator | Keyword Approach |
|----------------|------------------|
| **CarPlay-native** | Must be in name or subtitle |
| **No subscription** | Mention in description, subtitle |
| **Network-agnostic** | "All chargers", "200K+ stations" |
| **One-time purchase** | Description emphasis |

---

## App Name Recommendations

**Constraint:** 30 character max

### Option 1: CarPlay-First Positioning
**Name:** `ChargeMap: CarPlay EV Finder`  
**Length:** 29 chars  
**Pros:** Emphasizes unique CarPlay advantage, clear function  
**Cons:** "ChargeMap" might confuse with "Chargemap" competitor

---

### Option 2: Simple + Network-Agnostic
**Name:** `AllCharge: EV Charger Finder`  
**Length:** 29 chars  
**Pros:** Implies network-agnostic, clear function  
**Cons:** Less emphasis on CarPlay

---

### Option 3: Speed/Simplicity Focus
**Name:** `QuickCharge: Find EV Stations`  
**Length:** 30 chars  
**Pros:** Speed angle (matches "NearCharge" positioning), action-oriented  
**Cons:** "QuickCharge" might imply fast charging only

---

### Option 4: Direct & Functional
**Name:** `EV Charger Map for CarPlay`  
**Length:** 27 chars  
**Pros:** Direct keyword match, CarPlay emphasis  
**Cons:** Less brandable, generic

---

### Option 5: Premium/Simple Angle
**Name:** `Charger - Simple EV Finder`  
**Length:** 27 chars  
**Pros:** Clean, emphasizes simplicity (matches product philosophy)  
**Cons:** "Charger" alone may be too short/confusing

---

## Subtitle Recommendations

**Constraint:** 30 character max

| App Name Option | Subtitle | Total Chars |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| ChargeMap | `CarPlay EV Charging Stations` | 29 |
| AllCharge | `200K Chargers, No Subscription` | 30 |
| QuickCharge | `Fast EV Finder for CarPlay` | 27 |
| EV Charger Map | `200K Stations, One-Time Buy` | 28 |
| Charger | `CarPlay EV Map, No Subscription` | 31 ❌ Too long |

---

## Keyword Field Strategy

**Constraint:** 100 characters, comma-separated, no spaces

**Recommended Keywords:**
```
ev,electric car,tesla,charging station,carplay,ccs,chademo,j1772,fast charger,map,finder,open charge
```
**Length:** 99 characters

**Rationale:**
- Short keywords maximize coverage
- Brand names omitted (Apple indexes app name automatically)
- Connector types for specific searches
- "carplay" critical differentiator
- "open charge" for users seeking Open Charge Map alternative

---

## Top Recommendation

**App Name:** `AllCharge: EV Charger Finder`  
**Subtitle:** `CarPlay Map, No Subscription`  
**Keywords:** (see above)

**Why:**
- **"AllCharge"** signals network-agnostic (key differentiator)
- **"EV Charger Finder"** = primary keyword match
- **Subtitle** highlights CarPlay + no subscription (unique advantages)
- Total 59 chars leaves room for future tweaks
- Brandable but descriptive

---

## Alternative Considered

If user wants CarPlay to be primary:

**App Name:** `ChargeNow: CarPlay EV Finder`  
**Subtitle:** `200K Stations, One-Time Buy`

This puts CarPlay in the name (higher ASO weight) but sacrifices "network-agnostic" signal.

## Next Steps for S5-03

2. **Write full description** (4000 chars) emphasizing differentiators
3. **Finalize keyword list** (100 chars)
4. **A/B test screenshots** with chosen name/subtitle
